Disputes over the appropriate allocation and development of the water resources of the river have remained a subject of conflict between India and Bangladesh for almost 35 years, with several bilateral agreements and rounds of talks failing to produce results.[26][27][28]

Negotiations have been going on since 1983.[29][30][31] In 1983, a temporary solution had been worked outâ€” Bangladesh would get 36%, India would get 39% while the rest of the water remained unallocated.[30] Both countries signed a water sharing treaty in 1996 which would look into water sharing between the two countries in general following the Ganges water dispute.[30] The water sharing remains a challenge.[30]

In recent developments, Bangladesh's interim government water advisor, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, told news agency PTI (Press Trust of India) on September 1, 2024, that both upper and lower riparian countries must follow international water-sharing principles. If a treaty remains out of reach, it could mark a significant shift in India-Bangladesh relations if diplomacy fails.[32]
